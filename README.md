# System-Analysis-and-Design


The owner of the Driver Pass company is our client. He wants us to design a system that allows subrscribers to his service to be able to log in online, take courses and quizzes, and schedule driving time with instructors to practice the skills they're learning. I think I did a good job on the diagram creations. I think I covered every part of the needed use case, and reflected the appropriate activity or sequence in an understandable way. If I could revise any part of the documents I would want to improve the presentation. I think I created a good base and all the info is accurate and true to the system goals, but I would want to present that to the client in a more engaging way. I could add more diagram pictures and footnotes.

To implement my design I first collected the user requirements and broke it into function, nonfunctional, and technical categories. Then I analyzied each section and expanded on them using experience and practical sense. It all starts with the client but you also have to consider the user's needs because they are the paying customers and they have a different perspective to it than the owner. So to keep them coming back and using the system you have to consider their needs and make it as easy as possible for them. I will continue to operate this way for future design projects because it is an efficient way of analyzing and designing systems.
